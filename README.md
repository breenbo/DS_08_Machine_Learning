Report :

You can fin it here in pdf format, here in html, or here for the .rnw.

Study contains functions for :
- taking list of algorithms to test with the caret package. The shortcuts of algorithms must be understable by the train function.
- training and testing the algorithms with cross validation on 10 folders, repeated 3 times, on a small datasets for quickview
- select the 5 bests models based on their accuracy, then train and test them on the global dataset, with cross-validation on 10 folders, repeated 3 times
- let the scientist to choose which model is finally the best

PreProcess, metrics, seed, control method, number of folder and repeats are arguments of functions, and can be tweaked.

Please note that I'm not a native english, but I'm working on it ;-)
